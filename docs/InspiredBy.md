# InspiredBy

This project has been partially InspiredBy the work of [Chris Reddington](https://github.com/chrisreddington) and his [Cloud with Chris](https://github.com/CloudWithChris) project that he showed me during 2022.

It also has been inspired from the conferences like PSConfAsia in 2015/2016 that I provided some support with tasks as needed by the core organising team.

It also has been inspired by projects that I have worked on as well as other events that I have ran in the past

For more info about some of this please check out my blog, which is missing a Events I've Organised page (which is on the to-do list!)
